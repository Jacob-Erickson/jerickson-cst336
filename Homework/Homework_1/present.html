                    Presently A.I. is used for a variety of tasks such as allowing a computer to interpret the sound of the human voice as a set of instructions that can be acted upon.
                    A.I. has spread to a variety of uses from creating artificial opponents in a game to moving vehicles through busy cities and even analyzing the human eye for signs of diabetic retinopahy which, if not treated promptly, can lead to loss of vision.
                    Additinally one of the key powers of A.I. is its ability to look for patterns in a mass of information that is too large for humans to handle.
