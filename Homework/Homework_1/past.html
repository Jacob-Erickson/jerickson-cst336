                    A.I. began in the 1950s when a Dartmouth professor gathered a group of scientist for a few weeks to try and make machines accomplish tasks like using language.
                    In the end this gathering was not sucessful however it did jump start research into what machines could do with inteligence.
                    At first the focus was on solving abstract problems in math and science.
                    However it then slowly evolved to the point where machines could be made that could even beat humans at intelectual games such as checkers and/or chess.
