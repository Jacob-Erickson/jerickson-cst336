                    Looking to the future we can see that as life, science and technology continually advance in complexity humans will only be able to handle so much.
                    One example of this would be space travel.
                    At the moment it would very likely be possible to send humans on a one way indefinate trip into outerspace.
                    However without the ability to contact earth for information about the environment the spacecraft would have to handle all of the information about its surroundings by itself.
                    And when it comes to this there are just too many variables for humans to handle.
                    A human wouldn't be capable of analyzing possibly thousands if not tens of thousands of moving objects, calculate their trajectory and adjust for them in a short span of time.
                    Therefore it falls to A.I. to keep the spaceships safe by analyzing the environment.
