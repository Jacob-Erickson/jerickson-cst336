                    To begin to understand this let us first look at the two individual words in "artificial inteligence." 
                    Artificial describes something that does not occur naturally in nature.
                    Inteligence describes an ability to make decisions or take actions based on certain information.
                    Putting them together means creating something that does not occur in nature that has the ability to make decisions or take actions based on certain information.
                    And the way for humans to use this is to integrate them into machines.
